Computer Vision Technique to Detect Accidents
# Objective
A smart city accident detection system, using computer vision, is essential for swift emergency responses. Traditional methods can't provide 24/7 coverage, but this system continuously monitors via cameras and AI. When it detects an accident, it instantly alerts nearby hospitals and patrol services via Gmail or similar means. This technology reduces response times, potentially saving lives, and improves first aid support. It also helps identify accident-prone areas for better preparedness. Prioritizing data security and privacy, this solution enhances public safety and emergency services, proactively mitigating accident consequences.
